# Introduction

The **HIAS Bluetooth IoT Agent** is a bridge between HIAS devices that support Bluetooth/Bluetooth Low Energy protocol and the HIASCDI Context Broker.

&nbsp;

# HIAS

![HIAS - Hospital Intelligent Automation Server](assets/images/HIAS.jpg)

[HIAS - Hospital Intelligent Automation Server](https://github.com/AIIAL/HIAS-Server) is an open-source automation server designed to control and manage an intelligent network of IoT connected devices and applications.

&nbsp;

# HIAS IoT Agents

The HIAS iotJumpWay Agents are a selection of protocol/transfer specific applications that act as a bridge between the HIAS Context Broker and the devices and applications connected to the HIAS network via the iotJumpWay. Supported protocols currently include HTTP, MQTT, Websockets, AMQP and Bluetooth/Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).

Each IoT Agent provides a North & South Port interface that allows communication to and from the Context Broker.

The North Port interface of an IoT Agent listens to southbound traffic coming from the Context Broker towards the devices and applications.

The IoT Agent sends southbound traffic to devices and applications using a protocol that is supported by the device/application, and receives northbound traffic from the devices/applications which it then forwards to the Context Broker.
